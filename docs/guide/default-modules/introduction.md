# Default Gateway

The Storefront API architecture [is modular](../modules/introduction.md). You can create custom modules to support different GraphQL and Elastic schemas along with custom REST endpoints.

The default modules we provide are compatible with [Vue Storefront](https://vuestorefront.io) eCommerce PWA and are pretty much similar to Magento interfaces. The essential advantage here is that we already have [integrations](../integration/integration.md) for eCommerce platforms like Magento1, Magento2, and Spree and these integrations are compatible with the default data formats and APIs.

You can easily integrate your custom platfrom by [following our integration tutorial](../integration/integration.md).
