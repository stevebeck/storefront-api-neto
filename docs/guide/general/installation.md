## 0. Introduction
So, you are interested in **Storefront API**? Well, that's why you are here. You've made a choice. Your decision will most certainly pay off, which is great. Be it developers, entrepreneurs, or even marketing managers who may want to try something new with the hope of enhancing their clients' or customers' experience, you chose the right path. We will explore everything you need to get you started with [**Storefront API** infrastructure](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/storefront-api).

## 1. Installation with Docker
Docker has been arguably the most sought-after development tool ever brought to market, and has taken took the community by storm. Although it's still controversial whether it's the best choice among its peers, I have never seen such unanimous enthusiasm over one tech product throughout the whole developer community. 

Why is this so? In modern computer engineering, products are so complex, with an endless list of dependencies intertwined with each other. Building such dependencies in place, for every situation where they are required, is one hell of a job, to say nothing of the glitches from all the version variations. That's where Docker steps in to help you achieve **infrastructure automation**. This concept was conceived to help you focus on your business logic rather than having you stuck with the hassles of lower-level tinkering. 

Luckily, we have already been through all this for you, getting our hands dirty and doing a lot of the legwork for you. All you need to do is run a set of docker commands to get you up and running from scratch. Without further ado, let's get started!

### 1. Preparation
- You need [`docker`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04) and [`docker-compose`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-18-04) installed. 

- You need [`git`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-18-04) installed.

:::tip NOTE
We will walk you through installation with docker on *Linux*. (Specifically *Ubuntu 18.04*)

There is only one bias for Docker before using it; *Run it on Linux*. Docker is native to Linux and was created using a Linux technology; LXC (linux container). Even though there were many attempts to make it available on other platforms as it is on Linux (and there has definitely been progress in this regard), using Docker on Linux is the most reliable way to deal with the technology. 

:::

### 2. Recipe
1. First, download [**Storefront API**](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/storefront-api) from github.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DivanteLtd/storefront-api.git storefront-api
cd storefront-api
```

2. Copy `./config/default.json` to `./config/local.json`
```bash
cp config/default.json config/local.json
```
Then edit `local.json` to suit your needs. 

:::tip TIP
This step can be skipped if you are OK with the default values in `default.json` since it follows the [files load order](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Configuration-Files#file-load-order) of [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config)

:::

3. Run the following Docker command : 

To use Storefront API with embedded Elastic 7:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Then, to restore the demo data set, please run:
`docker exec -it sfa_app_1 yarn restore7`

The result would look something like this : 
```bash

```

:::tip TIP
The `-f` flag allows you to use the following docker-compose file. Without this flag, it will use the default file that is `docker-compose.yml`

The `-d` flag allows you to run the command in `detach mode` which means *running in the background*.
:::
3. In order to verify, run `docker ps` to show which containers are up:
```bash
docker ps 
```

Then, 
```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                            NAMES

7d8f6328601b        sfa_app      "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   31 seconds ago      Up 27 seconds       0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp                           safa_app_1
165ae945dbe5        sfa_es1      "/bin/bash bin/es-doâ€¦"   8 days ago          Up 30 seconds       0.0.0.0:9200->9200/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9300->9300/tcp   elasticsearch
8dd144746cef        redis:4-alpine            "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   11 days ago         Up 31 seconds       0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp                           sfa_redis_1
```
The ports number will be used later in the frontend configuration. In fact, they are already set as default values. 

You will see four containers are running, which are:
| Container              |          Port       |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Storefront API app     | :8080               |
| Elasticsearch          | :9200               |
| Redis                  | :6379               |


### 3. Peep into the kitchen (what happens internally) 
We used `docker-compose` to set up the entire environment of Storefront API. It was more than enough to launch the machines needed behind the scenes to run the shop.

It was possible because `docker` encapsulated the whole infrastructure into a linear set of declarative descriptions for the desired state. 

The `docker-compose` command took a `yml` file for input. This file describes its base requirements, but also **Storefront API** itself; that is, **Elasticsearch** as a data store, **Redis** for caching and **Kibana** for helping you grab your data visually (a partner to Elasticsearch).
```yaml
version: '3.0'
services:
  es1:
    container_name: elasticsearch
    build: docker/elasticsearch/
    ulimits:
      memlock:
        soft: -1

    ports:
      - '9200:9200'
      - '9300:9300'
    environment:

  kibana:
    build: docker/kibana/
    volumes:

:::tip NOTE 
Once a term is explained, it will be ignored thereafter for consecutive occurrences.
:::
`version` denotes which version of `docker-compose` this file uses.  

`services` describe containers and codifies how they should run. In other words, it codifies option flags used with `docker run ...`

`es1` contains information about the data store *Elasticsearch* container.
- `build` denotes the build path of the container.
- `volumes` contains the mount paths of volumes shared between host and container, defined as *host:container*
- `ports` connects ports between the host and container, defines as *host:container*
- `environment` allows you to add environment variables. `Xmx512m` means JVM will take up to a maximum of 512MB memory. `Xms512m` means minimum memory. Combining them, there will be no memory resize, it will just stick to 512MB from start to finsih throughout its life cycle. 

`kibana` contains information about the *Kibana* application container.
- `depends_on` defines dependencies of a container on other containers. So, this container is dependent on `es1`  which was described above. 
- `volumes` means volumes shared, `:ro` creates the volume in `read-only` mode for the container. 

`redis` contains information about the *Redis* cache application container. 

- The `image` node contains the name of the image this container is based on. 

`volumes` can be defined at the top level to as a reference to be used across multiple services (containers). 
<br />
<br />

`app` contains information about the *Storefront API* application. 
- `build` is the path for build information. If the value is string, it's a plain path. When it's an object, you may have a few options to add. `context` is a relative path or git repo url where the `Dockerfile` is located. The `dockerfile` node may change the path/name of `Dockerfile`. [more info](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#build)
- `depends_on` tells us this container is based on the `es1` and `redis` containers we created above. 
- `env_file` helps you add environment values from files. It's a relative path from the `docker-compose` file that is in the process. In this case, it's `docker-compose.nodejs.yml`  
- `environment` is used to set `VS_ENV` as `dev` so that the environment will be set up for developer mode. 
- `tmpfs` denotes temporary volumes that are only available to host memory. Unlike `volumes`, this `tmpfs` will be gone once the container stops. This option is only available on *Linux*.
